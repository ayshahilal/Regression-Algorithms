# Regression-Algorithms
In this project I will be implementing 8 different regression algorithms and comparing the results. I coded Logistic Regression algorithm by myself and I used the rest of the regression algorithms from Scikit-Learn Library. I created a dataset from rental home ads using BeautifulSoup library in Python.

Regression Algorithms in the project:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. K Nearest Neighbor
4. Naive Bayes AlgoritmalarÄ±
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes 
6. Multinomial Naive Bayes 
7. Complement Naive Bayes 
8. Bernoulli Naive Bayes
9. Logistic Regression (my own algorithm)
